# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

### Overview
This project is centered around customer segmentation using unsupervised learning, specifically K-Means clustering. The aim is to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, and other relevant data, allowing businesses to target marketing efforts more effectively.

### Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared raw customer data for optimal analysis.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Implemented the K-Means algorithm to identify and group customers into clusters.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visual representations of clusters to highlight customer segment characteristics.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compared different metrics like silhouette scores to validate the clustering approach.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook
